#  CampusFix AI  
> Fix campus issues fast. No fear. No paperwork. Just click.

If you’ve ever had a leaking faucet in your hostel, broken chairs in your classroom, or worse — an issue you were afraid to report — you know how frustrating it can be to get it fixed. Complaints get ignored, paperwork gets lost, and students fear judgment.

**We built CampusFix AI to change that.**
